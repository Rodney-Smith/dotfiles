# Welcome to my .dotfiles Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Rodney-Smith/dotfiles/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

## Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

Expected formulas:
- brew install docker
- brew install kubectl
- brew install zsh-history-substring-search
- brew install git git-ssh git-flow git-lfs gist

If you want to figure out what default needs changing, do the following:
1. cd ~
2. Store current defaults in file: `defaults read > before`
3. Make a change to your system: `sudo /Users/whoami/.osx`
4. Store new defaults in file: `defaults read > after`
5. Diff the files: `diff before after`

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

```

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Rodney-Smith/dotfiles/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
